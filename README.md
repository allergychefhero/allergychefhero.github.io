# AllergyGamification

This project is a web application created for kids ages 5 to 9. This game would hopefully teach them more about allergies and 
what they are, as well as reduce the possible negative stigma surrounding allergies present at that age. 

To run the application, start with opening the index.html file in a web browser. 

The ingredlist_TEMPLATE.html and recipequiz_TEMPLATE.html pages are simply template pages. The 4 main "types" of pages are the 
index page, information page (about the allergy), recipe quiz page, ingredient list page, and the thank you page (for when the 
dishes have been prepared). 

There are 3 characters created (their images in the "char" directory), each with their own storyline. Each storyline has its  
own set of html pages mentioned above, which are in the "storylines" directory. In that directory, each character has a 
subdirectory with their respective pages. 

In addition to the custom css files (which are in the css directory) and js files (which are in the js directory) that the team 
has created for each "type" of page, the team has imported Bootstrap 4 and jquery, whose files are in the "vendor" directory. 

All of the images and gifs used in the web application are in the "sprites" folder. In that folder, the image files are organized 
by allergy. Dani with a dairy allergy, Nick with a nut allergy, and Shelly with a seafood allergy.
